# aztrofatum

This website is a project requirement for the course Web Development.

The aztro API is an open-source API that can provide yesterday’s, today’s, and tomorrow’s horoscope readings for all 12 sun signs. It can also provide other horoscope information, including mood, lucky color, lucky number, lucky time, and compatibility with other signs. Based on these functionalities, I have come up with a mobile application idea that will perfectly utilize this API. I call it "aztroFatum".

The aztroFatum is a simple horoscope app that enables users to view astrological predictions regarding their zodiac signs, including daily horoscope readings and information, as well as check their compatibility with other signs. In this application, users simply click on their sun sign to access the relevant information. The website then sends a request to the aztro API to retrieve all the needed information for the user to see. Then, based on the user's sun sign, the application will send a request to aztro API to retrieve all the needed information for the user to see.
